Really basic Circle Detector, without the use of any additional libraries. It does the algorithm described in the challenge: scaling and converting the image to grayscale, implementing the Sobel operator and finally the Hough transform. In addition, I blur the image to reduce the noise. However, it is still not really accurate and it takes some time to actually find a circle or at least a part of a circle. I included some pictures, which I tested, in the package
